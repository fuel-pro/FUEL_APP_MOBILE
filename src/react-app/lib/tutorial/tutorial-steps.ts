/**
 * Adaptive onboarding tutorial content.
 *
 * Two parts:
 *   - BASIC: day-to-day features every user needs.
 *   - ADVANCED: day-to-day recap + complex/technical features for skilled
 *     operators (analytics, integrations, founder admin console, compliance).
 *
 * Steps are ADAPTIVE: each step declares an optional `applies` predicate
 * evaluated against the live feature flags + canonical tab list + registered
 * founder sections. Steps for features not available in the user's
 * tenant/region are dropped automatically, keeping the tutorial in sync with
 * the site as features are added, removed, or country-gated.
 *
 * One-time experience: completion persisted per-user under
 * SETUP_KEYS.ONBOARDING_COMPLETE. Replayable from the Header.
