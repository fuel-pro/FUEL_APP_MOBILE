# FuelPro Mobile — Repository Knowledge

## Project Overview
React + Vite + TypeScript SPA for fuel station management. Deployed at
`fuel-app-mobile.vercel.app`. Backend is Supabase (project ref:
`ojjscjwatikixlpshmub`). Auth via Supabase email/password.

## Key Architecture
- `src/react-app/context/StationContext.tsx` — station CRUD, localStorage
  persistence (`fuelpro_stations_v3`), Supabase cross-device sync.
- `src/react-app/context/FuelContext.tsx` — tab configuration registry.
- `src/react-app/pages/Home.tsx` — main app shell with tab system.
  SalesZote modules (Products, Sales Invoices, Purchases, Expenses, Reports,
  Terminal, EnhancedDashboard) are ADDITIVE lazy-loaded tabs, NOT a replacement
  of the FuelPro tab system.
- `src/react-app/context/AuthContext.tsx` — Supabase auth + role bindings.

## Critical Patterns / Gotchas
- **Persist-effect race**: `StationProvider` has a persist `useEffect` that
  runs on the first render when `stations` is still the initial `[]`. Without
  the `didHydrateRef` guard it overwrites a non-empty `fuelpro_stations_v3`
  with `[]` before the load-from-storage effect hydrates state. DO NOT remove
  that guard.
- **Supabase schema**: the live project was missing `owner_id` (and several
  other columns) on `stations`, and the `app_kv` table did not exist. Migration
  applied 2026-08-08 (see `/tmp/migration.sql` + `supabase/migrations/`).
  `pushStationUpsert` fails silently if these are missing — check schema if
  cross-device sync stops working.
- **Currency**: `getDetectedCurrency()` resolves KES for Kenya. Admin config
  `fuelpro_admin_v3.systemConfig.currency` upgrades stale "USD" to detected
  value on load (see `loadFromStorage`).
- **Math.random** usages are all legitimate ID/hash generation, not fake data.

## Deployment
- Vercel project: `prj_hjVrMLO7CxLTI77kthGE020eI3oj` (team:
  `leons-projects-78a92c96`).
- **Prebuilt deploy method (works, bypasses rate limit + bad buildCommand)**:
  The project's configured `buildCommand` is `cd app && npm install --legacy-peer-deps
  && npm run build:static`, pointing at an `app/` subdir that does NOT exist in the
  repo root. So a plain `vercel deploy dist --prod` FAILS with "npm install exit 254"
  (no package.json in dist). The ONLY reliable deploy path is the Build Output API:
    1. `VERCEL_ORG_ID=team_HvnupSUe9C1kfvUEQ5LFXOju VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=prj_... npx
       vercel build --prod --token=$VERCEL --scope=leons-projects-78a92c96 --yes`
       → produces `.vercel/output/` (builds.json + config.json + static/ + functions/).
    2. `npx vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --scope=... --token=$VERCEL --yes`
       → uploads prebuilt artifacts; Vercel skips its build; aliases to
       fuel-app-mobile.vercel.app. Deploy shows `prebuilt: true, type: LAMBDAS`.
  The `.vercel/` dir is gitignored. The REST API alone (POST /v13/deployments with
  uploaded file shas) does NOT work because Vercel still runs the configured
  buildCommand regardless of `prebuilt=1` / `projectSettings.buildCommand=null`.
- **Cloudflare Pages** is the unlimited mirror: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=$CLOUDFLARE
  npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=fuel-app-mobile --branch=main`.
- Vercel `api-deployments-free-per-day` limit (100/day) can be exhausted. Resets ~24h.
  Read-only GET deployments use a separate 1000/min bucket and still work when the
  deploy bucket is exhausted.
- **2026-08-09 state**: ALL pending fixes bundled into ONE prebuilt production deploy
  (dpl_EWoYGAJKzB1ZTmNa8B57MafvEJrD, READY/PROMOTED, aliased fuel-app-mobile.vercel.app,
  serving commit 8711452 build index-CaU-pkZQ.js). Cloudflare Pages synced to same
  build. Production is now current with origin/main HEAD 8711452.

## Build / Test
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — typecheck (must pass before commit).
- `npm run build` — Vite production build.
- No test suite configured.

## Credentials
- Supabase service_role key and access token are in `/workspace/API KEYS.txt`
  (project `ojjscjwatikixlpshmub`). NEVER commit these.
- Vercel token in `$VERCEL`. GitHub token in `$GITHUB_TOKEN`.
