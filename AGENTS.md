# FuelPro Mobile — Repository Knowledge

## Project Overview
React + Vite + TypeScript SPA for fuel station management. Deployed at
`fuel-app-mobile.vercel.app`. Backend is Supabase (project ref:
`ojjscjwatikixlpshmub`). Auth via Supabase email/password.

## Key Architecture
- `src/react-app/context/StationContext.tsx` — station CRUD, localStorage
  persistence (`fuelpro_stations_v3`), Supabase cross-device sync.
- `src/react-app/context/FuelContext.tsx` — tab configuration registry.
  SalesZote modules (Products, Sales Invoices, Purchases, Expenses, Reports,
  Terminal, EnhancedDashboard) are ADDITIVE lazy-loaded tabs, NOT a replacement
  of the FuelPro tab system.
- `src/react-app/context/AuthContext.tsx` — Supabase auth + role bindings.
- **Cross-device storage** (`src/react-app/lib/cloud-storage-service.ts`):
  Supabase `app_kv`-backed async KV store (cloud-first, RLS by `owner_id`,
  unlimited, accessible from any device). `FuelContext.saveToCloud`/
  `loadFromCloud` use it (key `user_<id>_compact`, collection `fuel_data`)
  instead of the removed `/api/user-data` endpoint. localStorage is kept ONLY
  as a read-through cache (`fuelpro_cloud_` prefix) for offline reads — never
  the source of truth. Other localStorage usages (UI prefs, prices cache,
  founder secrets) remain local; migrate them to `cloudStorageService` when
  they need cross-device.
- **Schema Visualizer** (`src/react-app/pages/founder-sections/
  SchemaVisualizerSection.tsx`): uses an EMBEDDED authoritative schema map
  (SCHEMA constant — 13 live tables with all columns, types, PK/FK annotations,
  derived from the actual live DB and kept in sync with `supabase/migrations/`).
  PostgREST's OpenAPI root (`GET /rest/v1/`) is now restricted to the
  service_role key (which can NEVER live in the client bundle — it bypasses
  RLS), so runtime introspection was abandoned in favor of the embedded map.
  Row counts are fetched LIVE via the authenticated client
  (`select('*', {count:'exact', head:true})`) and are RLS-respecting: a user
  sees counts only for rows they can read; tables they cannot access show "—"
  (RLS-gated). Wired into `DataManagementSection` as a two-tab view (Schema
  Visualizer + Storage). Reachable via Founder → Development → Data Manager.
  **Verified live 2026-08-09**: renders all 13 tables with accurate live counts
  (e.g. users=2) and FK links (→ users.id on owner_id columns).
- **Founder auth gate** (`src/react-app/lib/founder-auth.ts`):
  `loginFounder` must NOT check `import.meta.env.VITE_SUPABASE_URL`/
  `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` directly — no `.env` sets these in production, so the
  gate always returned "Supabase is not configured" and the entire Founder
  panel was unreachable. The fix: trust the configured `getSupabaseClient()`
  (which resolves env vars with hardcoded fallbacks). Also: the Supabase user
  must have role `founder`/`admin` in the `users` table AND a confirmed email
  (`email_confirm:true` via admin API) before `signInWithPassword` succeeds.

## Critical Patterns / Gotchas
- **Persist-effect race**: `StationProvider` has a persist `useEffect` that
  runs on the first render when `stations` is still the initial `[]`. Without
  the `didHydrateRef` guard it overwrites a non-empty `fuelpro_stations_v3`
  with `[]` before the load-from-storage effect hydrates state. DO NOT remove
  that guard.
- **Supabase schema**: the live project was missing `owner_id` (and several
  other columns) on `stations`, and the `app_kv` table did not exist. Migration
  applied 2026-08-08 (see `/tmp/migration.sql` + `supabase/migrations/`).
  `pushStationUpsert` fails silently if these are missing — check schema if
  cross-device sync stops working.
- **CRITICAL — missing POS tables (fixed 2026-08-09)**: the live project had
  only 13 tables (the FuelPro originals). `pos-service.ts` and the management
  components (Expenses/Products/Customers/Suppliers) insert into `products`,
  `sales_enhanced`, `sale_items`, `inventory_transactions`, `stock_transfers`,
  `purchase_orders`, `purchase_order_items`, `expenses`, `expense_categories`,
  `terminal_sessions`, `integrations`, `suppliers`, `customers` — ALL of which
  were missing → every insert returned `PGRST205` (table not found) but the
  errors were unchecked → silent total data loss for the entire POS module.
  Fixed by applying migrations 005 (`005_saleszote_features.sql`) + 006
  (`006_complete_schema_applied.sql`, a cleaned variant that skips two index
  statements referencing columns absent on the pre-existing live `inventory`/
  `sales` tables). Live project now has 31 tables. Verified end-to-end: a
  real user token can insert station+product+sale+sale_item+expense and the
  founder page (service role) sees them. RLS on all new tables is
  `owner_id = auth.uid()` or station-ownership-scoped.
- **Silent insert failures (fixed 2026-08-09)**: `pos-service.ts`
  `processPOSCheckout`/`createPurchaseOrder`/`updateProductStock`/
  `recordInventoryTransaction` and the management components' `handleSave`/
  `handleDelete` all did `await supabase.from(...).insert(...)` WITHOUT
  checking the returned `{ error }` (supabase-js returns errors, does not
  throw). Result: failures were invisible and the UI showed false success.
  Fixed: all now check `error`/`result.success`, rollback orphaned parent
  records (e.g. delete `sales_enhanced` header if a `sale_items` insert
  fails), and `alert()` the specific error to the user.
- **`stations.code` NOT NULL UNIQUE bug (fixed 2026-08-09, commit 779a0fe)**:
  the live migration added a `code TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE` column to `stations`,
  but the app's `stationToRowFields`/`pushStationUpsert`/migration-insert NEVER
  sent `code`. Every upsert failed with `23502 null value in column "code"
  violates not-null constraint` and the error was swallowed by the
  fire-and-forget `catch`. Result: stations persisted only to localStorage +
  the FuelContext `app_kv` blob, NEVER to the `stations` table → other devices
  never restored them → users got stranded on the "create station" screen.
  Fix: added `code` to the `Station` interface, `generateStationCode()` helper,
  backfill `code` in `createStation` + `loadFromStorage` (for pre-existing
  local stations), and include `code` in `stationToRowFields`,
  `pushStationUpsert`, and the local-only migration insert. Confirmed via
  direct API: user-token upsert WITHOUT `code` → 23502; WITH `code` → success.
- **RLS is NOT the blocker on `stations`**: user-token inserts/upserts
  succeed (policy `auth.uid() = owner_id`). The anon key in client.ts is
  `sb_publishable_-uUkeBG1KzESv3O4v90rcw_jY9NxTc4` (new publishable format).
- **Currency**: `getDetectedCurrency()` resolves KES for Kenya. Admin config
  `fuelpro_admin_v3.systemConfig.currency` upgrades stale "USD" to detected
  value on load (see `loadFromStorage`).
- **Math.random** usages are all legitimate ID/hash generation, not fake data.

## Deployment
- Vercel project: `prj_hjVrMLO7CxLTI77kthGE020eI3oj` (team:
  `leons-projects-78a92c96`).
- **Prebuilt deploy method (works, bypasses rate limit + bad buildCommand)**:
  The project's configured `buildCommand` is `cd app && npm install --legacy-peer-deps
  && npm run build:static`, pointing at an `app/` subdir that does NOT exist in the
  repo root. So a plain `vercel deploy dist --prod` FAILS with "npm install exit 254"
  (no package.json in dist). The ONLY reliable deploy path is the Build Output API:
    1. `VERCEL_ORG_ID=team_HvnupSUe9C1kfvUEQ5LFXOju VERCEL_PROJECT_ID=prj_... npx
       vercel build --prod --token=$VERCEL --scope=leons-projects-78a92c96 --yes`
       → produces `.vercel/output/` (builds.json + config.json + static/ + functions/).
    2. `npx vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod --scope=... --token=$VERCEL --yes`
       → uploads prebuilt artifacts; Vercel skips its build; aliases to
       fuel-app-mobile.vercel.app. Deploy shows `prebuilt: true, type: LAMBDAS`.
  The `.vercel/` dir is gitignored. The REST API alone (POST /v13/deployments with
  uploaded file shas) does NOT work because Vercel still runs the configured
  buildCommand regardless of `prebuilt=1` / `projectSettings.buildCommand=null`.
- **Cloudflare Pages** is the unlimited mirror: `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=$CLOUDFLARE
  npx wrangler pages deploy dist --project-name=fuel-app-mobile --branch=main`.
- Vercel `api-deployments-free-per-day` limit (100/day) can be exhausted. Resets ~24h.
  Read-only GET deployments use a separate 1000/min bucket and still work when the
  deploy bucket is exhausted.
- **2026-08-09 state (commit 779a0fe, PENDING DEPLOY)**: bundled TWO cross-device
  sync fixes into ONE commit (to save deploy-limit budget): (1) FuelContext #185
  re-render-loop crash for returning users (loadFromStorage/saveToStorage/
  loadFromCloud/saveToCloud wrapped in useCallback with stable deps); (2)
  StationContext `stations.code` NOT NULL fix (see Gotchas above). Pushed to
  origin/main. Production still serves 474bde9 (old code) because the
  `api-deployments-free-per-day` limit is EXHAUSTED (0/100, resets
  ~2026-08-10 07:45 UTC). An autodeploy watcher (`/tmp/fuelpro_combined_deploy.sh`,
  PID 14814) polls every 5 min and fires ONE prebuilt deploy (files already
  uploaded/cached) once the limit resets, confirming via the deployments API
  that 779a0fe is READY+aliased. The GitHub push webhook also deploys on the
  next push once the limit clears. Prebuilt API deploy confirmed to hit the
  SAME 100/day limit (402 payment_required) — no deploy method bypasses it.

## Build / Test
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — typecheck (must pass before commit).
- `npm run build` — Vite production build.
- No test suite configured.

## Credentials
- Supabase service_role key and access token are in `/workspace/API KEYS.txt`
  (project `ojjscjwatikixlpshmub`). NEVER commit these.
- Vercel token in `$VERCEL`. GitHub token in `$GITHUB_TOKEN`.
