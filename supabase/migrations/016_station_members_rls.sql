-- Migration 016: Allow station members (invited Manager/Staff/Auditor) to
-- READ the station they were invited to.
--
-- ROOT CAUSE: the stations table RLS only allows `owner_id = auth.uid()`.
-- An invited user (manager/staff/auditor) who accepted an invite via
-- /#/join/<token> has a row in station_members (station_id, user_id,
-- status='accepted') but does NOT own the station. So the station never
-- appears in their StationContext.syncStationsWithSupabase query → they
-- land on the "create station" screen even though they just joined a
-- station as a manager.
--
-- FIX: add a SELECT policy that allows a user to read any station where
-- they have an accepted station_members row. This is the minimal,
-- least-privilege policy — members can READ the station (so it appears
-- in their station list) but CANNOT update/delete it (only the owner can).

  );

-- Also allow members to read inventory/sales/pumps/etc for their station
-- (these were previously owner-only, so invited staff couldn't see any
-- station data even after joining). These are SELECT-only policies —
-- members can READ station data but writes are governed by the existing
-- owner-scoped policies (or per-table member policies added below).
