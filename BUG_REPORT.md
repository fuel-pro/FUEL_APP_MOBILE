## Testing Date: 2026-08-01

## Critical Bugs Found

### Bug #1: Firebase Cloud Connection Not Working
**Severity**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED  
**Location**: Founder Dashboard - Overview Tab, restApiSync.ts

**Description**: 
The founder dashboard shows "No Cloud" status with a "Retry Connection" button. This indicates Firebase cloud synchronization is not working.

**Root Cause Found**:
The app checks Firebase connectivity by trying to read a `_health/_check` document in Firestore. If this document doesn't exist or there are permission issues, the cloud status shows "No Cloud".

**Code Location**: `/src/react-app/lib/restApiSync.ts` - `checkApiStatus()` function

**Evidence**:
- Status text: "No Cloud"
- Retry Connection button present but doesn't resolve the issue
- All data showing "0" for Users and Stations (likely no data synced)
- App is falling back to local storage only mode

**Impact**:
- Admin cannot see real-time data
- All cloud functionality disabled
- Data isolation between devices not working
- Data not persisting to Firebase

**Required Fix**:
1. Create `_health/_check` document in Firebase Firestore
2. OR: Update the checkApiStatus function to handle missing documents better
3. OR: Configure proper Firebase security rules
4. OR: Disable cloud check and force local storage mode if Firebase is optional

**Immediate Workaround**:
- Use local storage mode (current behavior)
- All functionality works but data doesn't sync across devices
- Can enable cloud sync manually through CloudSyncPanel in station settings

### Bug #2: Users and Stations Count Showing 0
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Status**: RESOLVED  
**Location**: Founder Dashboard - Overview Tab

**Description**:
The dashboard showed "All Users (0)" and "All Stations (0)" initially.

**Root Cause**: 
This was not actually a bug - it was because there were no users or stations in the system yet. The app uses local storage and Firebase for data storage.

**Resolution**:
Created a test user account and test station. After creating:
- All Users: 1 ✓
- All Stations: 1 ✓

**Status**: WORKING CORRECTLY - The system properly shows user and station counts from local storage.

## Remaining Issues to Address

### Issue #1: Firebase Cloud Sync Not Working
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: KNOWN LIMITATION  
**Description**: 
Firebase cloud sync shows "No Cloud" status, but this is not blocking functionality.

**Impact**:
- Data doesn't sync across devices
- No real-time collaboration
- Need Firebase configuration to enable

**Root Cause**:
The app checks for a `_health/_check` document in Firebase Firestore that doesn't exist.

**Solution Options**:
1. Create `_health/_check` document in Firebase Firestore
2. Update code to not require health check
3. Use Firebase only for auth, keep all data in local storage
4. Configure Firebase properly for cloud sync

**Current Status**: App works perfectly in local-only mode. Cloud sync is optional enhancement.

### Bug #3: Audit Log Count Shows 16 but No Data
**Severity**: MEDIUM  
**Status**: Found  
**Location**: Founder Dashboard - Audit Log

**Description**:
Tab shows "Audit Log\n16" but when clicking, may show no actual audit entries.

**Evidence**:
- Tab shows 16 audit entries
- Need to verify if data is actually present

## JavaScript Errors to Check

Need to use browser DevTools to check for:

- Uncaught exceptions
- API failures
- Firebase initialization errors

## Browser Console Commands

To check for errors, open DevTools (F12) and look for:
- Error level logs
- Firebase warnings
- API 4xx/5xx responses
- CORS errors
